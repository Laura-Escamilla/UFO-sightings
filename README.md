# UFO-sightings

## Overview of Project

For this Project we used JavaScript to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria. We also applied skills on HTML and Bootstrap.

We customized a webpage using Bootstrap and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. 

## Results

The webpage we customized have different filters where the user can search with specific criteria: we included the Date, City, State, Country, and shape that will allow us to see the information about UFO sightings.

To get the results we are looking for, we enter in the webpage and scroll down to see the search boxes where we can input the criteria we want. For example, if we want to see the sightings in an specific city, we write in the respective box “Fresno” and we will see a table with the info about the sightings that have happened in Fresno.

## Summary

**A drawback of this webpage**

For the search we must write exactly as the information is stored, for example: the city, state or country have to be written in lower cases, if we add that capital letter, we won´t get the info. Also, we don’t have any instruction that could guide a user to input the information required.

**Recommendations for further development**

We can add filters for the duration and comments info that could get different and more information base on these extra criteria.

Add a button to make it easier for the user when they want to use at least one search box, also we can add simple instructions on how we can search and what are the criteria, like I we can use upper cases or not.
